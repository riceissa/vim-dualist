# dualist.vim

`dualist.vim` provides a pimped up list mode.

## Feature highlights

- Trailing whitespace appears in normal mode but disappears in insert mode.
  When you're inserting text, you don't want to see every new space character
  as a visible space, but after you're done inserting text, you _do_ want to see
  if there's any trailing whitespace.

## Installation

The plugin works with the major plugin managers. For instance
with [vim-plug][plug] just place in your `.vimrc`:

    Plug 'riceissa/vim-dualist'

## License

Distributed under the same terms as Vim itself. See `:help license`.
